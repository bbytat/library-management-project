=============================== LIBRARY MANAGEMENT APPLICATION IN C ======================================


Use :
-Books
    - Store

there are 50 books in the library database.
each book is known by its call number: the TITLE, the AUTHOR, the NUMBER OF LOANS and the LIST OF LOANS

If the book is not borrowed, it is by default borrowed from student n° 0 and return date =0

    - The class delivers:

use the method which searches for a book in the database from its call number.
to also write on follows the same method more or less as reading.
The Display() method

- Student
    - Registered

The registrant file contains 10 students: these are the members of our group
One who borrowed a book and has a 16 franchise. The others borrowed a single book and no franchise.

    - The student class:
We used the same procedure as the book stock to read and write the data in the registrant file.
In addition there is the add method useful for the registration operation and the delete() method useful for the registration operation,
both methods are realized by recursive functions.
The search() method is like in the .

- The waiting line :
    - file.txt file*

This file contains initialization data which contains students 1 and 2 who are already enrolled and other students.

   - The class file:

It contains the destructor constructor and thread scroll void...*
Nothing to explain because it uses the same properties as other classes (recursive functions and linked lists).

- Date
   - The date.txt file

The date.txt file is simply used to record today's date during the general recording of the simulation for the
next use of the program. (one word “dd/mm/yyyy”).

    - the date class:

This is where we really struggled in terms of string<->int and on conversion for pinality processing and
calculates the return date of a borrowed book.
This class contains the method deltadate(date) which allows the calculation of the difference between two dates of type char* in order to calculate the difference between today's date and the return date for processing the penalty.
The return() method which returns a character string in date format. it is called when borrowing a book to calculate the return date.
There is also the validate() method which checks the format of today's date e=inserted by the user.
The day, month and year attributes are integers extracted from the attribute which is a date like char*.

- The structures.h file:

It contains the structure definitions for linked lists.
